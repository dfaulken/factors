A simple Ruby script to determine which of the naturals in a given range has the greatest number of divisors.

Invoke as "ruby factors.rb x", where x is the largest natural you wish the script to traverse (default is 100).

As an example, the command

> ruby factors.rb

produces the output:

  The natural less than or equal to 100 with the greatest number of factors is 60.
  60 has 12 factors:
  60 = 1 x 60
  60 = 2 x 30
  60 = 3 x 20
  60 = 4 x 15
  60 = 5 x 12
  60 = 6 x 10
